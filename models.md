# Object Detection and Classification in Marine Survey

Object detection and classification are two fundamental tasks in computer vision. 
While object detection involves identifying the presence and location of certain 
objects within an image, classification assigns a label to a detected object based on 
its category.

## Applications in Marine Survey

### Object Detection:
- **Marine Life Monitoring**: Detecting the presence of marine species such as fish, 
whales, or coral reefs in underwater images.
- **Ship and Submarine Detection**: Identifying the presence of ships or submarines 
in satellite or aerial images.
- **Underwater Equipment Inspection**: Detecting and locating underwater equipment 
like pipelines, cables, or sunken artifacts.

### Classification:
- **Species Classification**: Once a marine species is detected, classifying it into 
its specific species category.
- **Health Assessment**: Classifying the health of coral reefs or other marine 
ecosystems based on visual cues.
- **Water Quality Assessment**: Classifying water quality based on visual properties 
like turbidity or the presence of algae.

## Popular Models and Their Applications in Marine Survey

### EfficientNet (PyTorch Implementation):
- **Overview**: EfficientNet is a model designed for image classification that scales 
the depth, width, and resolution of the network.
- **Application**: Efficient for classifying marine species or assessing the health 
of marine ecosystems.

### YOLOv8:
- **Overview**: YOLOv8 is an evolution of the YOLO architecture, focusing on real-time object detection. It divides images into a grid and predicts bounding boxes and class probabilities simultaneously.
- **Application**: Due to its real-time capabilities, YOLOv8 is suitable for monitoring 
marine activities in real-time, such as tracking marine species or detecting 
unauthorized fishing activities.

| EfficientNet (PyTorch Implementation) | Classifying marine species or assessing the health of marine 
ecosystems.                                           |
| YOLOv8       | Monitoring marine activities in real-time, such as tracking marine 
species or detecting unauthorized fishing activities. |

## Conclusion

While YOLOv8 stands out for real-time detection, the PyTorch implementation of EfficientNet offers versatility in classification tasks. The choice of model largely depends on the specific requirements of the marine survey task. With tools like TensorFlow Lite and PyTorch, even resource-intensive models can be optimized for real-time applications.
