A note on why this efficientNet model is more *efficient* than CN's model.

1. **Modularity and Flexibility**:
   - Klu's Model provides utility methods for initializing the EfficientNet model in various ways (`from_name`, `from_pretrained`). This makes it easier to create different variants of the model or load pretrained weights.

2. **Model Variants**:
   - Klu's Model explicitly defines various EfficientNet model variants (`efficientnet-b0` to `efficientnet-b8` and `efficientnet-l2`). This allows users to easily choose a specific variant based on their requirements.

3. **Detailed Implementation**:
   - The `MBConvBlock` in Klu's Model is a more detailed implementation of the mobile inverted residual block, providing a clearer understanding of the block's operations.

4. **Comprehensive Documentation**:
   - Klu's Model offers more detailed comments and references to academic papers, which can be beneficial for users unfamiliar with the EfficientNet architecture or those looking to understand the underlying principles.

5. **Drop Connect Implementation**:
   - Klu's Model implements the drop connect regularization technique in the `MBConvBlock`, which can improve model robustness and generalization.

6. **Endpoint Extraction**:
   - The `extract_endpoints` method in Klu's Model allows users to obtain intermediate feature maps from various stages of the model. This can be useful for tasks like feature visualization or for architectures that require multi-scale feature maps.

7. **Activation Function Flexibility**:
   - Klu's Model provides a method (`set_swish`) to switch between memory-efficient and standard versions of the Swish activation function. This offers flexibility during training (memory efficiency) and deployment (standard version for export).

8. **Input Channel Flexibility**:
   - Klu's Model includes a method (`_change_in_channels`) to adjust the model's first convolution layer based on the number of input channels. This makes the model adaptable to datasets with different numbers of input channels.

9. **Validation of Model Names**:
   - Klu's Model contains a method (`_check_model_name_is_valid`) to validate the model name, ensuring that users select a valid EfficientNet variant.

10. **Adaptation**:
   - Klu's model is adapted from lukemelas' efficientNet ![model](https://github.com/lukemelas/EfficientNet-PyTorch/tree/master/efficientnet_pytorch)
